# Modern To-Do App

This is a simple and modern To-Do application designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. The app features a sidebar menu for easy navigation between different task views and categories, and a main content area to display and manage tasks.

## Features

- **Sidebar Menu**: Navigate between different sections such as Upcoming tasks, Todayâ€™s tasks, Calendar view, Sticky Wall, Lists, and Tags.
- **Today Section**: View and add tasks for the current day.
- **Upcoming Section**: Organize tasks for today, tomorrow, and the current week.
- **Calendar Section**: Placeholder for a calendar UI to visualize tasks by date.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes for better usability.
- **Task Management**: Add new tasks easily with input fields and buttons.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that defines the look and feel of the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the appâ€™s functionality such as adding tasks, toggling themes, and switching sections.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the sidebar to navigate between different task views.
3. Add tasks in the "Today" or "Upcoming" sections using the input fields and buttons.
4. Toggle the theme using the "ðŸŒ“ Theme" button in the header.

## Future Improvements

- Implement the calendar UI in the Calendar section.
- Add task editing and deletion features.
- Enhance the Sticky Wall section for notes or reminders.
- Add persistent storage to save tasks between sessions.

This project is a great starting point for building a full-featured task management app.
